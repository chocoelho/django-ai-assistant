# Django AI Assistant

Implement powerful AI Assistants using Django.
Combine the power of Large Language Models with Django's productivity.

Regardless of the feasibility of AGI, AI assistants are (already!) a new paradigm for computation.
AI agents and assistants allow devs to easily build applications with smart decision logic
that would otherwise be too expensive to build and maintain. 

The latest LLMs from major AI providers have a "killer feature" called Tool Calling,
which enables AI models to call provided methods from Django's side, and essentially
do anything a Django view can, such as accessing DBs, checking permissions, sending emails,
downloading and uploading media files, etc.

While users commonly interact with LLMs via conversations, AI Assistants can do a lot with any kind of string input, including JSON.
You can abstract from your application's end user that a LLM is doing the heavy-lifting behind the scenes!
Some ideas for innovative AI assistants:

- A movie recommender chatbot that helps users manage their movie backlogs
- An autofill button for certain forms of you application
- Personalized email reminders that consider user's written preferences and application's recent notifications
- A real-time audio guide for tourists that recommends attractions given the user's current location

We have an open-source example with some of those applications. But it's best to start with the [Get Started](get-started.md) guide.
